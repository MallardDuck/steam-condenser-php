Steam Condenser
===============

A fork of the original Steam Condenser this is a multi-language library for querying the Steam
Community, Source and GoldSrc game servers as well as the Steam master servers.

The dev versions released by packagist will be more or less unstable, I intend to release
stable features on a 2.x.x-MD branch scheme. I don't have enough stable features implemented yet
to warrent a release in this manner but I hope to soon.

## Requirements

* Linux, MacOS X or Windows
* PHP 5.4 or newer

The following PHP library is required:

* Monolog

Composer will install this for you.

The following extensions are required:

* `bcmath` (for Steam ID conversions)
* `bz2` (for Source servers sending compressed responses)
* `json` (for the Web API features)
* `simplexml` (for the Steam Community features)
* `sockets` (for all server queries)
